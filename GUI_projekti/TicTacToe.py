TIE-02106 Introduction to Programming, Summer 2020

GUI-project:
- Classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
- 2 players (determined in global constant PLAYER_COUNT)
- Upon starting, game asks for names. Empty names or names containing only
  whitespace/s aren't allowed. Everything else goes.
- After confirming names, select a grid size from given options and confirm.
  This will initiate the game.

  GAMEPLAY:
- Players take turns in placing their marks on game board. Mark must be placed
  in an empty slot.
- Winner is whoever forms a connected chain with their own mark from one side
  of the game board to the other, as in full row, full column or 
  full diagonal.
- After game ends, it is possible to continue with same players by
  selecting desired grid size and confirming it again.
- Game will keep track of won rounds and present them in the right side
  of the screen.

  MISC:
- "Reset all" will reset program to its initial state

!Attempted level == Scalable Interface!
- Tried to make the code so that theoretically it would be scalable for any
    amount of players, grid sizes, etc...
